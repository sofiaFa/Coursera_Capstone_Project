    "British people have been called to the polling booths many times in recent years: Brexit Referendum, general elections, early general elections, mayoral elections, local elections etc. Voter fatigue has been increasing, which makes it even more important to understand where it is worth spending more energy (and money) canvassing and campaigning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Greater London area has 73 parliamentary constituencies, while the UK as a whole has 650 constituencies. Wards constitute the “building blocks” (according to “Boundary Commission for England”).\n",
    "Understanding what drives a constituency to vote for a certain party can be helpful in many ways.\n",
    "First, the boundaries of constituencies are regularly reviewed and amended to be fairer and more equal. This is a subjective measure, and should be tested against a range of innovative ways to make sure the governing party is not taking through boundaries more favourable to them.\n",
    "Second, campaign optimization can be empowered by data science. This is particularly relevant because of the rising costs of campaigns (and the multiplication of votes…).\n",
