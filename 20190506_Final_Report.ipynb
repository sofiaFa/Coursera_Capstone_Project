    "\n",
    "British people have been called to the polling booths many times in recent years: Brexit Referendum, general elections, early general elections, mayoral elections, local elections etc. Voter fatigue has been increasing, which makes it even more important to understand where it is worth spending more energy (and money) canvassing and campaigning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Greater London area has 73 parliamentary constituencies, while the UK as a whole has 650 constituencies. Wards constitute the “building blocks” (according to “Boundary Commission for England”).\n",
    "Understanding what drives a constituency to vote for a certain party can be helpful in many ways.\n",
    "First, the boundaries of constituencies are regularly reviewed and amended to be fairer and more equal. This is a subjective measure, and should be tested against a range of innovative ways to make sure the governing party is not taking through boundaries more favourable to them.\n",
    "Second, campaign optimization can be empowered by data science. This is particularly relevant because of the rising costs of campaigns (and the multiplication of votes…).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the question that I will ask is:\n",
    "Using the results for the General Elections of 2017, can the data on venues in a specific constituency help predict how they will vote?\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be opened up to ward level, for local or parliamentary elections, as well as for other big questions like Brexit.\n",
    "It can also be extended to the rest of the UK.\n"

    "2. List of wards belonging to each constituency:\n",

    "I need the ward level to increase the granularity when compiling the list of venues in a constituency. Constituencies are fairly large areas, and hence would require more work to drill down the data.\n",
